# Linear Regression Predictor

## Overview
This Python program utilizes linear regression to predict data based on known data. Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. This README provides an overview of the program's functionality, usage instructions, and key components.

## Functionality
The program performs the following tasks:
- Loads the known data from a CSV file.
- Divides the data into training and testing sets.
- Trains a linear regression model using the training data.
- Predicts the dependent variable values for the testing data using the trained model.
- Evaluates the performance of the model by comparing predicted values with actual values.
- Visualizes the results through plots.

## Key Components
### 1. Data Loading and Preparation
The program reads the known data from a CSV file containing both independent and dependent variables. It preprocesses the data, handles missing values, and splits it into training and testing sets.

### 2. Linear Regression Model
The core component of the program is the linear regression model. It fits a linear equation to the training data, aiming to minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable.

### 3. Prediction and Evaluation
Once the model is trained, it predicts the dependent variable values for the testing data. The program evaluates the model's performance using various metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, or visual inspection of predicted vs. actual values.

### 4. Visualization
To aid in understanding the model's performance, the program provides visualizations such as scatter plots, regression lines, or residual plots.

## Usage
To use the program, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository containing the program files.
4. Prepare your known data in a CSV file format.
